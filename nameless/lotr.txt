All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us
Deserves it I daresay he does Many that live deserve death And some that die deserve life 
Can you give it to them Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement 
For even the very wise cannot see all ends
I am glad you are here with me Here at the end of all things Sam
I feel thin sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread
I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness nor the arrow for its swiftness nor the warrior for his glory I love only that which they defend
The world is indeed full of peril and in it there are many dark places
But still there is much that is fair And though in all lands love is now
